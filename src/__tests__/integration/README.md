# Integration Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests that validate the coordination and interaction between all services in the Blind Runner App.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Service Integration Manager (`ServiceIntegrationManager.ts`)
The central coordination hub that manages all app services and provides a unified interface for the main application flow.

**Key Features:**
- Initializes all services in correct order
- Sets up cross-service event handlers and integrations
- Manages app state and coordinates service interactions
- Handles error propagation and recovery
- Provides unified API for run management, settings, and emergency features

### 2. End-to-End Test Suites

#### Complete Run Workflow (`CompleteRunWorkflow.test.ts`)
Tests the entire run lifecycle from start to completion:
- Run start with GPS tracking and feedback
- Real-time metrics calculation and announcements
- Pause/resume functionality with auto-pause detection
- Kilometer milestones with TTS and haptic feedback
- Run completion with data persistence
- Background task management during runs

#### Accessibility Workflow (`AccessibilityWorkflow.test.ts`)
Validates accessibility features work seamlessly:
- Voice-only operation for complete app usage
- Screen reader integration (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
- Haptic-only operation when TTS fails
- High contrast and visual accessibility support
- Screen-off operation for critical features
- Accessibility error handling and recovery

#### Emergency Scenarios (`EmergencyScenarios.test.ts`)
Tests SOS functionality in various conditions:
- SOS activation during active runs with location data
- Hardware button SOS triggers
- SOS without emergency contacts configured
- Network failure handling and message queuing
- Emergency contact management and validation
- SOS functionality across different app states

#### User Journeys (`UserJourneys.test.ts`)
Comprehensive user workflow testing:
- First-time user setup and onboarding
- Daily running routines with all features
- Weekly training plan tracking
- Settings customization over time
- Emergency preparedness workflows
- Long-term usage with data accumulation

### 3. Core Integration Tests

#### Simple Integration (`SimpleIntegration.test.ts`)
Focused tests on service communication patterns:
- Event-driven service integration
- Settings propagation across services
- SOS integration workflow
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Background task coordination
- Data flow through the system
- State management consistency

## Integration Patterns Tested

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- Run tracking events trigger TTS announcements and haptic feedback
- Location updates flow to run tracking when active
- Hardware button events trigger SOS functionality
- Performance issues trigger error handling

### 2. Settings Synchronization
- Settings changes propagate to all relevant services
- Service-specific configuration updates
- Persistent settings storage and retrieval

### 3. Error Handling Integration
- Service failures handled gracefully with fallbacks
- Error propagation through error handling service
- User notification of issues via TTS
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

### 4. Background Task Coordination
- GPS tracking continues when app is backgrounded
- Performance monitoring during runs
- SOS functionality available in background
- State restoration after app restart

### 5. Data Persistence Integration
- Run data saved consistently across services
- Settings persistence and synchronization
- Emergency contact secure storage
- Offline data queuing and synchronization

## Test Execution

### Running All Integration Tests
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="integration" --watchAll=false
```

### Running Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Simple integration tests (fastest)
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="SimpleIntegration" --watchAll=false

# Core integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="CoreIntegration" --watchAll=false

# Navigation flow tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="NavigationFlow" --watchAll=false
```

### Running E2E Tests (Note: Requires additional setup)
```bash
# Complete workflow tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="CompleteRunWorkflow" --watchAll=false

# Accessibility tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="AccessibilityWorkflow" --watchAll=false

# Emergency scenario tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="EmergencyScenarios" --watchAll=false

# User journey tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns="UserJourneys" --watchAll=false
```

## Mock Strategy

The integration tests use a layered mocking approach:

1. **External Dependencies**: Expo modules (location, speech, haptics, etc.) are mocked at the Jest setup level
2. **Service Interfaces**: Individual services are mocked to focus on integration patterns
3. **Database Operations**: Database calls are mocked to avoid SQLite dependencies in tests
4. **Hardware Interactions**: Hardware button presses, sensor data, and system events are simulated
